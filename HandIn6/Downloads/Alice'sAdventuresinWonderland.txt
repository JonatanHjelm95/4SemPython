CHAPTER I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole


Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand what is the use of a book,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwithout pictures or conversations?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cORANGE MARMALADE\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d, but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice to herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cafter such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me
at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI wonder how
many miles I've fallen by this time?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said aloud. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, I think-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (for, you see, Alice had learnt
several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
practice to say it over) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-yes, that's about the right distance-but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (Alice had no
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI wonder if I shall fall right _through_
the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (she was rather
glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all
the right word) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke-fancy _curtseying_ as you're
falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd what
an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do
to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
(Dinah was the cat.) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And here
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and
sometimes, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDo bats eat cats?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d for, you see, as she couldn't answer
either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d when suddenly,
thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh my ears
and whiskers, how late it's getting!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand even if my head would go through,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought
poor Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
knew how to begin.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, (\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwhich certainly was not here
before,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDRINK ME,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It was all very well to say \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDrink me,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNo, I'll look first,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand see whether it's marked \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98_poison_' or not\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d; for she had read
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cpoison,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.

However, this bottle was _not_ marked \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cpoison,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d so Alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat a curious feeling!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI must be shutting up like a
telescope.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cfor it might end, you know,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
said Alice to herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I
wonder what I should be like then?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And she tried to fancy what the
flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
not remember ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome, there's no use in crying like that!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice to herself,
rather sharply; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI advise you to leave off this minute!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d She generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut it's no use now,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought poor Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cto pretend to be two
people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
person!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cEAT ME\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d were beautifully marked in currants. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, I'll eat it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said
Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll
get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhich way? Which
way?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
on in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

CHAPTER II.
The Pool of Tears


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCuriouser and curiouser!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cnow I'm
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off). \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, my poor little feet, I
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm
sure _I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;-but I must be
kind to them,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cor perhaps they won't walk the way I
want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThey must
go by the carrier,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she thought; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand how funny it'll seem, sending
presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

     _Alice's Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with
     Alice's love_).

Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ca great girl like
you,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (she might well say this), \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cto go on crying in this way! Stop
this moment, I tell you!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d But she went on all the same, shedding
gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh! the Duchess, the
Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice felt
so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf you please,
sir-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, _that's_ the great puzzle!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm sure I'm not Ada,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cfor her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, _she's_ she, and _I'm_ I, and-oh dear, how
puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
and four times seven is-oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try
Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
Rome, and Rome-no, _that's_ all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been
changed for Mabel! I'll try and say \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98_How doth the little_-'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and she
crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
did not come the same as they used to do:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every golden scale!

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm sure those are not the right words,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've
made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be
no use their putting their heads down and saying \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Come up again, dear!'
I shall only look up and say \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Who am I then? Tell me that first, and
then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down
here till I'm somebody else'-but, oh dear!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried Alice, with a sudden
burst of tears, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
_very_ tired of being all alone here!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while
she was talking. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow _can_ I have done that?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she thought. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI must be
growing small again.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat _was_ a narrow escape!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand
now for the garden!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and she ran with all speed back to the little
door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
key was lying on the glass table as before, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand things are worse than
ever,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought the poor child, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cfor I never was so small as this
before, never! And I declare it's too bad, that it is!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand in that case I can go back by
railway,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
she was nine feet high.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI wish I hadn't cried so much!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
sure! However, everything is queer to-day.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWould it be of any use, now,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cto speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d So she
began: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cA mouse-of
a mouse-to a mouse-a mouse-O mouse!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d) The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cPerhaps it doesn't understand English,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI daresay it's
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So she began again: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cO\xc3\x83\xc2\xb9 est ma chatte?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
fright. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, I beg your pardon!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
had hurt the poor animal's feelings. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI quite forgot you didn't like
cats.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNot like cats!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWould
_you_ like cats if you were me?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, perhaps not,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice in a soothing tone: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cdon't be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
quiet thing,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
in the pool, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
paws and washing her face-and she is such a nice soft thing to
nurse-and she's such a capital one for catching mice-oh, I beg your
pardon!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe won't talk
about her any more if you'd rather not.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe indeed!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAs if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name
again!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI won't indeed!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAre you-are you fond-of-of dogs?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when
you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of things-I can't remember half of them-and it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says
it kills all the rats and-oh dear!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm afraid I've offended it again!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d For the Mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cMouse dear! Do come back again, and we
won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cLet us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a
Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice
led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.




CHAPTER III.
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale


They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank-the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI am
older than you, and must know better;\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and this Alice would not allow
without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to
tell its age, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I'll_ soon make
you dry enough!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAhem!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mouse with an important air, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9care you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria-'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cUgh!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Lory, with a shiver.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI beg your pardon!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDid
you speak?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNot I!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Lory hastily.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI thought you did,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mouse. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-I proceed. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable-'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cFound _what_?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duck.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cFound _it_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mouse replied rather crossly: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cof course you know
what \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98it' means.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI know what \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the
Duck: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98-found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
the crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence
of his Normans-' How are you getting on now, my dear?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d it continued,
turning to Alice as it spoke.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAs wet as ever,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice in a melancholy tone: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit doesn't seem to
dry me at all.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIn that case,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSpeak English!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Eaglet. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat I was going to say,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dodo in an offended tone, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwas,
that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat _is_ a Caucus-race?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice; not that she wanted much to
know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dodo, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthe best way to explain it is to do it.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (And,
as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
tell you how the Dodo managed it.)

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthe exact
shape doesn't matter,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOne, two, three, and
away,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
again, the Dodo suddenly called out \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe race is over!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and they all
crowded round it, panting, and asking, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut who has won?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
said, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut who is to give the prizes?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d quite a chorus of voices asked.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy, _she_, of course,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
confused way, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cPrizes! Prizes!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly
one a-piece, all round.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mouse.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOf course,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Dodo replied very gravely. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat else have you got in
your pocket?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he went on, turning to Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOnly a thimble,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice sadly.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHand it over here,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble;\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
cheered.

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as
she could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou promised to tell me your history, you know,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand why
it is you hate-C and D,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cMine is a long and a sad tale!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
sighing.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt _is_ a long tail, certainly,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the Mouse's tail; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut why do you call it sad?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:-

         \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cFury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Let us both
         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.-Come, I'll take no
         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I've
         nothing to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Such a trial, dear
         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.'
         \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' Said cunning old Fury: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98I'll
         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou are not attending!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mouse to Alice severely. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat are
you thinking of?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI beg your pardon,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice very humbly: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cyou had got to the fifth
bend, I think?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI had _not!_\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cA knot!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, do let me help to undo it!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI shall do nothing of the sort,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mouse, getting up and
walking away. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou insult me by talking such nonsense!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI didn't mean it!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d pleaded poor Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut you're so easily offended,
you know!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Mouse only growled in reply.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cPlease come back and finish your story!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice called after it; and
the others all joined in chorus, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYes, please do!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d but the Mouse only
shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat a pity it wouldn't stay!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d sighed the Lory, as soon as it was
quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to
her daughter \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
_your_ temper!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHold your tongue, Ma!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the young Crab, a little
snappishly. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou're enough to try the patience of an oyster!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cShe'd soon fetch it back!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the
Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you
can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI really must be getting home; the night-air
doesn't suit my throat!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and a Canary called out in a trembling voice
to its children, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome away, my dears! It's high time you were all in
bed!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
alone.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was
coming back to finish his story.




CHAPTER IV.
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
they were nowhere to be seen-everything seemed to have changed since
her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
little door, had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
called out to her in an angry tone, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
a fan! Quick, now!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off
at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
mistake it had made.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHe took me for his housemaid,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said to herself as she ran. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow
surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him
his fan and gloves-that is, if I can find them.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cW. RABBIT,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow queer it seems,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice said to herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cto be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Miss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!' \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Coming in a minute,
nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out.' Only I
don't think,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice went on, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthat they'd let Dinah stop in the house
if it began ordering people about like that!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three
pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label
this time with the words \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDRINK ME,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d but nevertheless she uncorked it
and put it to her lips. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI know _something_ interesting is sure to
happen,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said to herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so
I'll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large
again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's quite enough-I hope I shan't
grow any more-As it is, I can't get out at the door-I do wish I hadn't
drunk quite so much!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNow I
can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt was much pleasanter at home,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought poor Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwhen one wasn't
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole-and yet-and
yet-it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
when I grow up, I'll write one-but I'm grown up now,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she added in a
sorrowful tone; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cat least there's no room to grow up any more _here_.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut then,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cshall I _never_ get any older than I am
now? That'll be a comfort, one way-never to be an old woman-but
then-always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like _that!_\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, you foolish Alice!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she answered herself. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow can you learn
lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
for any lesson-books!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and
making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes
she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cMary Ann! Mary Ann!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the voice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cFetch me my gloves this moment!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThen I'll
go round and get in at the window.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_That_ you won't!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voice-the Rabbit's-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cPat! Pat! Where are you?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And
then a voice she had never heard before, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSure then I'm here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDigging for apples, indeed!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Rabbit angrily. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHere! Come and
help me out of _this!_\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (Sounds of more broken glass.)

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNow tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSure, it's an arm, yer honour!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (He pronounced it \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9carrum.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d)

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDo as I tell you, you coward!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat a number
of cucumber-frames there must be!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI wonder what
they'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
_could!_ I'm sure _I_ don't want to stay in here any longer!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together: she made out the words: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhere's the other
ladder?-Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other-Bill!
fetch it here, lad!-Here, put 'em up at this corner-No, tie 'em
together first-they don't reach half high enough yet-Oh! they'll do
well enough; don't be particular-Here, Bill! catch hold of this
rope-Will the roof bear?-Mind that loose slate-Oh, it's coming down!
Heads below!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (a loud crash)-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNow, who did that?-It was Bill, I
fancy-Who's to go down the chimney?-Nay, _I_ shan't! _You_ do
it!-_That_ I won't, then!-Bill's to go down-Here, Bill! the master says
you're to go down the chimney!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice to
herself. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I _think_ I can kick a little!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThis is Bill,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she gave one sharp kick, and waited
to see what would happen next.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere goes Bill!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
then the Rabbit's voice along-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCatch him, you by the hedge!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d then
silence, and then another confusion of voices-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHold up his head-Brandy
now-Don't choke him-How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's Bill,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought
Alice,) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, I hardly know-No more, thank ye; I'm better now-but I'm
a deal too flustered to tell you-all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSo you did, old fellow!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the others.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe must burn the house down!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice
called out as loud as she could, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf you do, I'll set Dinah at you!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI
wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the
roof off.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cA barrowful will do, to begin with.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cA barrowful of _what?_\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'll put a stop to
this,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said to herself, and shouted out, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou'd better not do that
again!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf I eat one of these cakes,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she thought, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit's sure to make
_some_ change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it
must make me smaller, I suppose.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get
through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of
little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,
was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe first thing I've got to do,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cis to grow to my right size again; and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
will be the best plan.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.

An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cPoor little
thing!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
spite of all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if-if I'd
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
I've got to grow up again! Let me see-how _is_ it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.

She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a
long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything
else.




CHAPTER V.
Advice from a Caterpillar


The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWho are _you?_\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI-I hardly know, sir, just at present-at least I know
who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar sternly. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cExplain
yourself!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbecause I'm
not myself, you see.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't see,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice replied very politely,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cfor I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt isn't,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut when you
have to turn into a chrysalis-you will some day, you know-and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
queer, won't you?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNot a bit,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9call I know
is, it would feel very queer to _me_.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWho are _you?_\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such _very_
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI
think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome back!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Caterpillar called after her. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've something
important to say!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cKeep your temper,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIs that all?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNo,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For
some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSo you
think you're changed, do you?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm afraid I am, sir,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI can't remember things as I
used-and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCan't remember _what_ things?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, I've tried to say \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow doth the little busy bee,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d but it all
came different!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cRepeat, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_You are old, Father William_,'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar.

Alice folded her hands, and began:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou are old, Father William,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the young man said,
    \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head-
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIn my youth,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Father William replied to his son,
    \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou are old,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the youth, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cas I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door-
    Pray, what is the reason of that?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIn my youth,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment-one shilling the box-
    Allow me to sell you a couple?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou are old,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the youth, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak-
    Pray, how did you manage to do it?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIn my youth,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said his father, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou are old,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the youth, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cone would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose-
    What made you so awfully clever?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI have answered three questions, and that is enough,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
    Said his father; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cdon't give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat is not said right,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNot _quite_ right, I'm afraid,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, timidly; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9csome of the
words have got altered.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt is wrong from beginning to end,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar decidedly,
and there was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat size do you want to be?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d it asked.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, I'm not particular as to size,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice hastily replied; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9conly one
doesn't like changing so often, you know.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI _don't_ know,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAre you content now?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn't
mind,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthree inches is such a wretched height to be.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt is a very good height indeed!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar angrily,
rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut I'm not used to it!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
thought of herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
offended!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou'll get used to it in time,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOne side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice to
herself.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOf the mushroom,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was
perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at
last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke
off a bit of the edge with each hand.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd now which is which?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a
violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome, my head's free at last!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat _can_ all that green stuff be?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd where _have_ my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,
she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that
her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
face, and was beating her violently with its wings.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSerpent!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d screamed the Pigeon.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm _not_ a serpent!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice indignantly. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cLet me alone!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSerpent, I say again!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
tone, and added with a kind of sob, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've tried every way, and nothing
seems to suit them!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI haven't the least idea what you're talking about,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
hedges,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut those
serpents! There's no pleasing them!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAs if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Pigeon;
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm very sorry you've been annoyed,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm a-I'm a-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell! _What_ are you?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Pigeon. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI can see you're trying to
invent something!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI-I'm a little girl,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cA likely story indeed!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's
no use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't believe it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Pigeon; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut if they do, why then
they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou're
looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt matters a good deal to _me_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice hastily; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut I'm not
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want
_yours_: I don't like them raw.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, be off, then!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well
as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome, there's half my plan
done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm
going to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my
right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden-how
_is_ that to be done, I wonder?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d As she said this, she came suddenly
upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhoever lives there,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit'll never do to come upon them
_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d So she
began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.




CHAPTER VI.
Pig and Pepper


For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
wood-(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
fish)-and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all
about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cFor the Duchess. An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cFrom the Queen.
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere's no sort of use in knocking,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Footman, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand that for
two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary
noise going on within-a constant howling and sneezing, and every now
and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
pieces.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cPlease, then,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9chow am I to get in?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere might be some sense in your knocking,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Footman went on
without attending to her, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cif we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
know.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut perhaps he can't help it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
she said to herself; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9chis eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
head. But at any rate he might answer questions.-How am I to get in?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
she repeated, aloud.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI shall sit here,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Footman remarked, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ctill tomorrow-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-or next day, maybe,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow am I to get in?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_Are_ you to get in at all?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Footman. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's the first
question, you know.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's really
dreadful,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she muttered to herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthe way all the creatures argue.
It's enough to drive one crazy!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI shall sit here,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he said, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9con and off, for
days and days.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut what am _I_ to do?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnything you like,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Footman, and began whistling.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, there's no use in talking to him,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice desperately: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9che's
perfectly idiotic!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And she opened the door and went in.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool
in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,
stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere's certainly too much pepper in that soup!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cPlease would you tell me,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwhy
your cat grins like that?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's a Cheshire cat,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand that's why. Pig!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't
know that cats _could_ grin.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThey all can,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand most of 'em do.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't know of any that do,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou don't know much,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand that's a fact.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the baby-the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, there goes his _precious_ nose!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d as an
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf everybody minded their own business,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthe world would go round a deal faster than it does.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhich would _not_ be an advantage,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, who felt very glad to
get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cJust
think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTalking of axes,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cchop off her head!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTwenty-four hours, I _think_; or
is it twelve? I-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, don't bother _me_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI never could abide
figures!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
the end of every line:

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSpeak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d


CHORUS.
(In which the cook and the baby joined):


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWow! wow! wow!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d


While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d


CHORUS.


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWow! wow! wow!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and she hurried out of the room. The cook
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cjust like a star-fish,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice. The poor little thing was
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for
the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it
out into the open air. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf I don't take this child away with me,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
thought Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthey're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be
murder to leave it behind?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDon't grunt,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthat's not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face
to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also
its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did
not like the look of the thing at all. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut perhaps it was only
sobbing,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there
were any tears.

No, there were no tears. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
said Alice, seriously, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNow, what am I to do
with this creature when I get it home?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d when it grunted again, so
violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than
a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
further.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf it had grown up,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said to
herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cif one only knew the right way to change them-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of
a tree a few yards off.

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCheshire Puss,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little
wider. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome, it's pleased so far,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice, and she went on.
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't much care where-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThen it doesn't matter which way you go,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-so long as I get _somewhere_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice added as an explanation.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, you're sure to do that,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cif you only walk long
enough.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
question. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat sort of people live about here?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIn _that_ direction,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9clives
a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d waving the other paw, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9clives a
March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut I don't want to go among mad people,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice remarked.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, you can't help that,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwe're all mad here. I'm mad.
You're mad.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow do you know I'm mad?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou must be,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cor you wouldn't have come here.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd how
do you know that you're mad?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTo begin with,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ca dog's not mad. You grant that?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI suppose so,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, then,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Cat went on, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cyou see, a dog growls when it's angry,
and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now _I_ growl when I'm pleased,
and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_I_ call it purring, not growling,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCall it what you like,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDo you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI should like it very much,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut I haven't been invited
yet.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou'll see me there,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat, and vanished.

Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBy-the-bye, what became of the baby?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'd nearly
forgotten to ask.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt turned into a pig,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI thought it would,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat, and vanished again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've seen hatters before,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she
said to herself; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthe March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad-at least not so mad as it
was in March.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDid you say pig, or fig?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI said pig,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d replied Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand I wish you wouldn't keep appearing
and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAll right,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell! I've often seen a cat without a grin,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut a
grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself
to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herself \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSuppose it should be raving mad after all!
I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d




CHAPTER VII.
A Mad Tea-Party


There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cVery
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9conly, as it's asleep,
I suppose it doesn't mind.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNo room! No room!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d they cried out when they saw
Alice coming. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere's _plenty_ of room!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice indignantly, and
she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHave some wine,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't see any wine,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she remarked.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere isn't any,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the March Hare.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThen it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice angrily.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said
the March Hare.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI didn't know it was _your_ table,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit's laid for a great
many more than three.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYour hair wants cutting,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter. He had been looking at
Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first
speech.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou should learn not to make personal remarks,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice said with some
severity; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit's very rude.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
was, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy is a raven like a writing-desk?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome, we shall have some fun now!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm glad they've
begun asking riddles.-I believe I can guess that,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she added aloud.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said
the March Hare.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cExactly so,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThen you should say what you mean,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the March Hare went on.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI do,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice hastily replied; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cat least-at least I mean what I
say-that's the same thing, you know.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNot the same thing a bit!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou might just as well
say that \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98I see what I eat' is the same thing as \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98I eat what I see'!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou might just as well say,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d added the March Hare, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthat \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98I like what
I get' is the same thing as \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98I get what I like'!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou might just as well say,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthat \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing
as \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98I sleep when I breathe'!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt _is_ the same thing with you,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writing-desks, which wasn't much.

The Hatter was the first to break the silence. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat day of the month
is it?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe fourth.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTwo days wrong!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d sighed the Hatter. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI told you butter wouldn't suit
the works!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt was the _best_ butter,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the March Hare meekly replied.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Hatter grumbled:
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cyou shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt was the _best_ butter,
you know.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat a
funny watch!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she remarked. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt tells the day of the month, and doesn't
tell what o'clock it is!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy should it?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d muttered the Hatter. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDoes _your_ watch tell you what
year it is?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOf course not,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice replied very readily: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut that's because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhich is just the case with _mine_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't quite
understand you,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said, as politely as she could.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe Dormouse is asleep again,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOf course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHave you guessed the riddle yet?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNo, I give it up,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice replied: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwhat's the answer?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI haven't the slightest idea,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNor I,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI think you might do something better with the
time,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthan waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf you knew Time as well as I do,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cyou wouldn't talk
about wasting _it_. It's _him_.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't know what you mean,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOf course you don't!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI dare say you never even spoke to Time!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cPerhaps not,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice cautiously replied: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut I know I have to beat
time when I learn music.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAh! that accounts for it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHe won't stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

(\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI only wish it was,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat would be grand, certainly,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice thoughtfully: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut then-I
shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNot at first, perhaps,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIs that the way _you_ manage?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice asked.

The Hatter shook his head mournfully. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNot I!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he replied. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe
quarrelled last March-just before _he_ went mad, you know-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (pointing
with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-it was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you're at!'


You know the song, perhaps?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've heard something like it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt goes on, you know,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Hatter continued, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cin this way:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle-'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d


Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and went on so long that they
had to pinch it to make it stop.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, I'd hardly finished the first verse,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwhen the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98He's murdering the time! Off with his
head!'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow dreadfully savage!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d exclaimed Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd ever since that,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9che won't
do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

A bright idea came into Alice's head. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIs that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she asked.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYes, that's it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter with a sigh: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit's always tea-time,
and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThen you keep moving round, I suppose?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cExactly so,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cas the things get used up.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut what happens when you come to the beginning again?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice ventured
to ask.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSuppose we change the subject,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm afraid I don't know one,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThen the Dormouse shall!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d they both cried. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWake up, Dormouse!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And
they pinched it on both sides at once.

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI wasn't asleep,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI heard every word you fellows were saying.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTell us a story!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the March Hare.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYes, please do!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d pleaded Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd be quick about it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d added the Hatter, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cor you'll be asleep again
before it's done.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOnce upon a time there were three little sisters,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Dormouse began
in a great hurry; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat did they live on?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, who always took a great interest
in questions of eating and drinking.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThey lived on treacle,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThey couldn't have done that, you know,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice gently remarked;
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthey'd have been ill.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSo they were,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dormouse; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_very_ ill.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut
why did they live at the bottom of a well?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTake some more tea,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've had nothing yet,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice replied in an offended tone, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cso I can't
take more.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou mean you can't take _less_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit's very easy to
take _more_ than nothing.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNobody asked _your_ opinion,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWho's making personal remarks now?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Hatter asked triumphantly.

Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
repeated her question. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt was a treacle-well.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere's no such thing!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSh! sh!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
yourself.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNo, please go on!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice said very humbly; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI won't interrupt again. I
dare say there may be _one_.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOne, indeed!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
go on. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd so these three little sisters-they were learning to draw,
you know-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat did they draw?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTreacle,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI want a clean cup,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d interrupted the Hatter: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9clet's all move one place
on.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou can draw water out of a water-well,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cso I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well-eh, stupid?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut they were _in_ the well,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
to notice this last remark.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOf course they were,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dormouse; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-well in.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThey were learning to draw,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand they drew all manner of
things-everything that begins with an M-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy with an M?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy not?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the March Hare.

Alice was silent.

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
little shriek, and went on: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness-you know you say
things are \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cmuch of a muchness\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d-did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cReally, now you ask me,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, very much confused, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't
think-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThen you shouldn't talk,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAt any rate I'll never go _there_ again!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice as she picked her
way through the wood. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
all my life!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's very curious!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she thought. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut
everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And
in she went.

Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
glass table. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNow, I'll manage better this time,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom
(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot
high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_-she found
herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds
and the cool fountains.




CHAPTER VIII.
The Queen's Croquet-Ground


A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
one of them say, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cLook out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me
like that!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI couldn't help it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Five, in a sulky tone; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSeven jogged my
elbow.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

On which Seven looked up and said, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's right, Five! Always lay the
blame on others!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_You'd_ better not talk!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Five. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat for?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the one who had spoken first.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's none of _your_ business, Two!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Seven.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYes, it _is_ his business!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Five, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand I'll tell him-it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, of all the unjust
things-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,
and all of them bowed low.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWould you tell me,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, a little timidly, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwhy you are
painting those roses?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
voice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d At this
moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe Queen! The Queen!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all
ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,
and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a
hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went
by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying
the King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand besides, what would be the use of a
procession,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought she, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cif people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldn't see it?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d So she stood still where she was,
and waited.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWho is this?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d She said it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIdiot!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
Alice, she went on, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat's your name, child?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy, they're only a pack of cards, after
all. I needn't be afraid of them!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd who are _these?_\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners
who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on
their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,
or courtiers, or three of her own children.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow should _I_ know?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's
no business of _mine_.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOff with her head! Off-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNonsense!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
silent.

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cConsider, my
dear: she is only a child!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTurn
them over!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cGet up!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cLeave off that!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d screamed the Queen. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou make me giddy.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat _have_ you been doing
here?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cMay it please your Majesty,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwe were trying-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_I_ see!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOff with their heads!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou shan't be beheaded!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAre their heads off?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d shouted the Queen.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTheir heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the soldiers shouted
in reply.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's right!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d shouted the Queen. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCan you play croquet?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYes!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d shouted Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome on, then!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's-it's a very fine day!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said a timid voice at her side. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cVery,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-where's the Duchess?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHush! Hush!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cShe's under
sentence of execution.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat for?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDid you say \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98What a pity!'?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Rabbit asked.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNo, I didn't,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't think it's at all a pity. I said
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98What for?'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cShe boxed the Queen's ears-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
scream of laughter. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, hush!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen said-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cGet to your places!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,
under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look
up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOff with his head!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d or \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOff with her head!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d about once in a
minute.

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand then,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought she, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwhat would become of me? They're dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any
one left alive!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
to herself \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
to.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow are you getting on?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's no use
speaking to it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she thought, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ctill its ears have come, or at least one
of them.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there
was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't think they play at all fairly,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
oneself speak-and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at
least, if there are, nobody attends to them-and you've no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the
arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
ground-and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow do you like the Queen?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Cat in a low voice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNot at all,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cshe's so extremely-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Queen smiled and passed on.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWho _are_ you talking to?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King, going up to Alice, and
looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's a friend of mine-a Cheshire Cat,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9callow me to
introduce it.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't like the look of it at all,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9chowever, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'd rather not,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Cat remarked.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDon't be impertinent,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand don't look at me like
that!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d He got behind Alice as he spoke.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cA cat may look at a king,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've read that in some book,
but I don't remember where.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, it must be removed,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cMy dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
small. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOff with his head!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said, without even looking round.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'll fetch the executioner myself,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King eagerly, and he
hurried off.

Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with
passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a
helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.

By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut it doesn't
matter much,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cas all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite
a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at _his_ time of life.

The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.

The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in
less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was
this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt belongs to the
Duchess: you'd better ask _her_ about it.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cShe's in prison,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Queen said to the executioner: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cfetch her here.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
And the executioner went off like an arrow.

The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so
the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
while the rest of the party went back to the game.




CHAPTER IX.
The Mock Turtle's Story


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's,
and they walked off together.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhen _I'm_ a Duchess,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful
tone though), \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI won't have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
does very well without-Maybe it's always pepper that makes people
hot-tempered,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
kind of rule, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand vinegar that makes them sour-and camomile that makes
them bitter-and-and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn't be
so stingy about it, you know-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou're thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cPerhaps it hasn't one,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice ventured to remark.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTut, tut, child!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cEverything's got a moral, if only
you can find it.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
she spoke.

Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe game's going on rather better now,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c'Tis so,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand the moral of that is-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Oh, 'tis love,
'tis love, that makes the world go round!'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSomebody said,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice whispered, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthat it's done by everybody minding
their own business!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAh, well! It means much the same thing,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand the moral of
_that_ is-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow fond she is of finding morals in things!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice thought to
herself.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
the Duchess said after a pause: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthe reason is, that I'm doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHe might bite,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
to have the experiment tried.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cVery true,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cflamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that is-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Birds of a feather flock together.'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOnly mustard isn't a bird,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice remarked.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cRight, as usual,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwhat a clear way you have of
putting things!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's a mineral, I _think_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOf course it is,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthere's a large mustard-mine near here.
And the moral of that is-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98The more there is of mine, the less there is
of yours.'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, I know!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
remark, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI quite agree with you,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand the moral of that
is-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Be what you would seem to be'-or if you'd like it put more
simply-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI think I should understand that better,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice said very politely,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cif I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's nothing to what I could say if I chose,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Duchess replied,
in a pleased tone.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cPray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said
Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, don't talk about trouble!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI make you a present
of everything I've said as yet.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cA cheap sort of present!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm glad they don't give
birthday presents like that!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d But she did not venture to say it out
loud.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThinking again?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've a right to think,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cJust about as much right,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Duchess, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cas pigs have to fly; and
the m-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away,
even in the middle of her favourite word \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98moral,' and the arm that was
linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the
Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a
thunderstorm.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cA fine day, your Majesty!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNow, I give you fair warning,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ceither you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! Take your choice!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cLet's go on with the game,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay
would cost them their lives.

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling
with the other players, and shouting \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOff with his head!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d or \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOff with
her head!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the
soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so
that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and
all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody
and under sentence of execution.

Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHave
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNo,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Queen.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI never saw one, or heard of one,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome on, then,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Queen, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand he shall tell you his history,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou are all pardoned.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome, _that's_ a
good thing!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the Queen had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If
you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cUp, lazy
thing!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Queen, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered;\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat fun!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat _is_ the fun?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy, _she_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cEverybody says \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98come on!' here,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
pitied him deeply. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat is his sorrow?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's all
his fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThis here young lady,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cshe wants for to know your
history, she do.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'll tell it her,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9csit
down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn't begin.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
But she waited patiently.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOnce,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI was a real
Turtle.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHjckrrh!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThank you, sir, for your interesting story,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d but she could not
help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhen we were little,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwe went to school in the
sea. The master was an old Turtle-we used to call him Tortoise-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice asked.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe called him Tortoise because he taught us,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle
angrily: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9creally you are very dull!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the
Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDrive on, old fellow! Don't be all
day about it!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and he went on in these words:

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI never said I didn't!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d interrupted Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou did,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHold your tongue!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
The Mock Turtle went on.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe had the best of educations-in fact, we went to school every day-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_I've_ been to a day-school, too,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cyou needn't be so
proud as all that.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWith extras?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYes,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwe learned French and music.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd washing?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCertainly not!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice indignantly.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAh! then yours wasn't a really good school,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle in a
tone of great relief. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNow at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98French, music, _and washing_-extra.'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou couldn't have wanted it much,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cliving at the bottom
of the sea.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI couldn't afford to learn it.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI
only took the regular course.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat was that?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d inquired Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cReeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mock Turtle
replied; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand then the different branches of Arithmetic-Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI never heard of \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Uglification,'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice ventured to say. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat is it?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat! Never heard of
uglifying!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d it exclaimed. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou know what to beautify is, I suppose?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYes,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice doubtfully: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit means-to-make-anything-prettier.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, then,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Gryphon went on, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cif you don't know what to uglify
is, you _are_ a simpleton.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so
she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat else had you to learn?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, there was Mystery,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
subjects on his flappers, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling-the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat was _that_ like?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, I can't show it you myself,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mock Turtle said: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHadn't time,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI went to the Classics master,
though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI never went to him,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9che taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSo he did, so he did,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, in a hurry
to change the subject.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTen hours the first day,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cnine the next, and so
on.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat a curious plan!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d exclaimed Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's the reason they're called lessons,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Gryphon remarked:
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbecause they lessen from day to day.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThen the eleventh day must have been
a holiday?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOf course it was,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice went on eagerly.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's enough about lessons,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Gryphon interrupted in a very
decided tone: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ctell her something about the games now.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d




CHAPTER X.
The Lobster Quadrille


The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSame as if he had a bone in his throat,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou may not have lived much under the sea-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI haven't,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said
Alice)-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
(Alice began to say \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI once tasted-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d but checked herself hastily, and
said \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNo, never\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNo, indeed,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat sort of a dance is it?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cyou first form into a line along the
sea-shore-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTwo lines!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried the Mock Turtle. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSeals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_That_ generally takes some time,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d interrupted the Gryphon.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-you advance twice-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cEach with a lobster as a partner!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried the Gryphon.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOf course,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mock Turtle said: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cadvance twice, set to partners-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-change lobsters, and retire in same order,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d continued the Gryphon.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThen, you know,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mock Turtle went on, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cyou throw the-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe lobsters!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-as far out to sea as you can-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSwim after them!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d screamed the Gryphon.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTurn a somersault in the sea!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cChange lobsters again!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBack to land again, and that's all the first figure,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt must be a very pretty dance,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice timidly.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWould you like to see a little of it?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cVery much indeed,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome, let's try the first figure!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, _you_ sing,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've forgotten the words.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWill you walk a little faster?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said a whiting to a snail.
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle-will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
But the snail replied \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cToo far, too far!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and gave a look askance-
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat matters it how far we go?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d his scaly friend replied.
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France-
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice,
feeling very glad that it was over at last: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand I do so like that
curious song about the whiting!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, as to the whiting,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthey-you've seen them,
of course?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYes,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've often seen them at dinn-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she checked herself
hastily.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI don't know where Dinn may be,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut if you've
seen them so often, of course you know what they're like.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI believe so,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice replied thoughtfully. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThey have their tails in
their mouths-and they're all over crumbs.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou're wrong about the crumbs,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ccrumbs would
all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;
and the reason is-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his
eyes.-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTell her about the reason and all that,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he said to the Gryphon.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe reason is,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthat they _would_ go with the
lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
couldn't get them out again. That's all.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThank you,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit's very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI can tell you more than that, if you like,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDo you
know why it's called a whiting?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI never thought about it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_It does the boots and shoes_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Gryphon replied very solemnly.

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDoes the boots and shoes!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she repeated
in a wondering tone.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy, what are _your_ shoes done with?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI mean, what
makes them so shiny?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThey're done with blacking, I believe.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBoots and shoes under the sea,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9care done with a whiting. Now you know.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd what are they made of?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSoles and eels, of course,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cany shrimp could have told you that.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf I'd been the whiting,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, whose thoughts were still
running on the song, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'd have said to the porpoise, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Keep back,
please: we don't want _you_ with us!'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThey were obliged to have him with them,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mock Turtle said: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cno
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWouldn't it really?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOf course not,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cwhy, if a fish came to _me_,
and told me he was going a journey, I should say \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98With what porpoise?'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDon't you mean \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98purpose'?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI mean what I say,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
the Gryphon added \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome, let's hear some of _your_ adventures.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI could tell you my adventures-beginning from this morning,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said
Alice a little timidly: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut it's no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cExplain all that,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNo, no! The adventures first,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cexplanations take such a dreadful time.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she
went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
about her repeating \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_You are old, Father William_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d to the
Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock
Turtle drew a long breath, and said \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's very curious.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's all about as curious as it can be,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt all came different!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cStand up and repeat \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98'_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the
Gryphon.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
thought Alice; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI might as well be at school at once.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d However, she got
up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

[later editions continued as follows
When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said
the Gryphon.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, I never heard it before,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut it sounds
uncommon nonsense.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI should like to have it explained,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Mock Turtle.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cShe can't explain it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon hastily. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cGo on with the next
verse.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut about his toes?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mock Turtle persisted. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHow _could_ he turn
them out with his nose, you know?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's the first position in dancing.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cGo on with the next verse,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit
begins \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98_I passed by his garden_.'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

[later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
And concluded the banquet-]


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Mock Turtle
interrupted, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cif you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the
most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYes, I think you'd better leave off,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Gryphon
went on. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOr would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98_Turtle Soup_,' will you, old
fellow?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBeautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen!
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
    Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!
    Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!
Soo-oop of the e-e-evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBeautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two p
ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!
    Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!
Soo-oop of the e-e-evening,
    Beautiful, beauti-FUL SOUP!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cChorus again!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe trial's beginning!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d was heard in the
distance.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome on!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat trial is it?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
answered \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome on!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSoo-oop of the e-e-evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d




CHAPTER XI.
Who Stole the Tarts?


The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them-all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the
court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI wish they'd
get the trial done,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she thought, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand hand round the refreshments!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at
everything about her, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's the judge,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said to
herself, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbecause of his great wig.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he
did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAnd that's the jury-box,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand those twelve creatures,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
(she was obliged to say \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ccreatures,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds,) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI suppose they are the jurors.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d She
said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little
girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cjury-men\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
would have done just as well.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat are
they doing?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice whispered to the Gryphon. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThey can't have anything
to put down yet, before the trial's begun.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThey're putting down their names,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Gryphon whispered in reply,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cfor fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cStupid things!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she
stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSilence in the
court!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,
to make out who was talking.

Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cstupid things!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cstupid,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cA nice
muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice.

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he
was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this
was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHerald, read the accusation!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King.

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cConsider your verdict,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King said to the jury.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNot yet, not yet!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere's a great
deal to come before that!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCall the first witness,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King; and the White Rabbit blew
three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cFirst witness!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI beg pardon, your
Majesty,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he began, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cfor bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished
my tea when I was sent for.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou ought to have finished,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhen did you begin?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cFourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he said.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cFifteenth,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the March Hare.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSixteenth,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d added the Dormouse.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWrite that down,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTake off your hat,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King said to the Hatter.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt isn't mine,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_Stolen!_\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI keep them to sell,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Hatter added as an explanation; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've none
of my own. I'm a hatter.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cGive your evidence,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand don't be nervous, or I'll
have you executed on the spot.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was
as long as there was room for her.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI wish you wouldn't squeeze so.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI can hardly breathe.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI can't help it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice very meekly: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm growing.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou've no right to grow _here_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dormouse.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDon't talk nonsense,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice more boldly: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cyou know you're growing
too.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Dormouse: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cnot in
that ridiculous fashion.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
to the other side of the court.

All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes
off.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cGive your evidence,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King repeated angrily, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cor I'll have you
executed, whether you're nervous or not.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm a poor man, your Majesty,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-and I hadn't begun my tea-not above a week or so-and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin-and the twinkling of the tea-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe twinkling of the _what?_\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt _began_ with the tea,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Hatter replied.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOf course twinkling begins with a T!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King sharply. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDo you
take me for a dunce? Go on!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm a poor man,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Hatter went on, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand most things twinkled after
that-only the March Hare said-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI didn't!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou did!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI deny it!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the March Hare.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHe denies it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cleave out that part.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, at any rate, the Dormouse said-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAfter that,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d continued the Hatter, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI cut some more bread-and-butter-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut what did the Dormouse say?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d one of the jury asked.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat I can't remember,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou _must_ remember,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d remarked the King, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cor I'll have you executed.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm a poor man, your Majesty,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he began.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King.

Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm glad I've seen that done,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI've so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere was some attempts at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and I never understood what it meant till now.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf that's all you know about it, you may stand down,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d continued the
King.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI can't go no lower,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'm on the floor, as it is.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThen you may _sit_ down,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King replied.

Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCome, that finished the guinea-pigs!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d thought Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNow we shall get
on better.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'd rather finish my tea,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou may go,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-and just take his head off outside,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCall the next witness!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King.

The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cGive your evidence,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cShan't,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the cook.

The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYour Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, if I must, I must,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat are tarts made of?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cPepper, mostly,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the cook.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTreacle,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said a sleepy voice behind her.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCollar that Dormouse,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Queen shrieked out. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBehead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNever mind!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King, with an air of great relief. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCall the
next witness.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cReally, my
dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my
forehead ache!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling
very curious to see what the next witness would be like, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-for they
haven't got much evidence _yet_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said to herself. Imagine her
surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill
little voice, the name \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAlice!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d




CHAPTER XII.
Alice's Evidence


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHere!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of
goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, I _beg_ your pardon!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident
of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of
idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the
jury-box, or they would die.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe trial cannot proceed,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King in a very grave voice, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cuntil
all the jurymen are back in their proper places-_all_,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he repeated
with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon
got it out again, and put it right; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cnot that it signifies much,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she
said to herself; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the
trial one way up as the other.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat do you know about this business?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King said to Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNothing,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNothing _whatever?_\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d persisted the King.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNothing whatever,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's very important,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King said, turning to the jury. They were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White
Rabbit interrupted: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he
said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
he spoke.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_Un_important, of course, I meant,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cimportant-unimportant-unimportant-important-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d as if he were trying
which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it down \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cimportant,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and some \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cunimportant.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut it doesn't matter a bit,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she thought to herself.

At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSilence!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and read out from his book, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cRule
Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

Everybody looked at Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_I'm_ not a mile high,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou are,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNearly two miles high,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d added the Queen.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWell, I shan't go, at any rate,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbesides, that's not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's the oldest rule in the book,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThen it ought to be Number One,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cConsider your
verdict,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the
White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthis paper has just been
picked up.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhat's in it?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Queen.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI haven't opened it yet,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the White Rabbit, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cbut it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to-to somebody.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt must have been that,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cunless it was written to
nobody, which isn't usual, you know.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWho is it directed to?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said one of the jurymen.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt isn't directed at all,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the White Rabbit; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cin fact, there's
nothing written on the _outside_.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
and added \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAre they in the prisoner's handwriting?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d asked another of the jurymen.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNo, they're not,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the White Rabbit, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand that's the queerest
thing about it.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (The jury all looked puzzled.)

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHe must have imitated somebody else's hand,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King. (The jury
all brightened up again.)

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cPlease your Majesty,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Knave, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI didn't write it, and they
can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf you didn't sign it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthat only makes the matter
worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed
your name like an honest man.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat _proves_ his guilt,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Queen.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt proves nothing of the sort!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy, you don't even know
what they're about!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cRead them,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King.

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhere shall I begin, please
your Majesty?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he asked.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBegin at the beginning,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King said gravely, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cand go on till you
come to the end: then stop.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:-

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThey told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

Don't let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d


\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the
King, rubbing his hands; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cso now let the jury-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf any one of them can explain it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, (she had grown so
large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of
interrupting him,) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's
an atom of meaning in it.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

The jury all wrote down on their slates, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c_She_ doesn't believe there's
an atom of meaning in it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d but none of them attempted to explain the
paper.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf there's no meaning in it,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthat saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't
know,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
them with one eye; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI seem to see some meaning in them, after all.
\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c-_said I could not swim_-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d you can't swim, can you?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he added, turning
to the Knave.

The Knave shook his head sadly. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDo I look like it?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he said. (Which he
certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAll right, so far,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King, and he went on muttering over the
verses to himself: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98_We know it to be true_-' that's the jury, of
course-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98_I gave her one, they gave him two_-' why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cBut, it goes on \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98_they all returned from him to you_,'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy, there they are!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King triumphantly, pointing to the
tarts on the table. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNothing can be clearer than _that_. Then
again-\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98_before she had this fit_-' you never had fits, my dear, I
think?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he said to the Queen.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNever!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long
as it lasted.)

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThen the words don't _fit_ you,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the King, looking round the
court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt's a pun!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King added in an offended tone, and everybody
laughed, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cLet the jury consider their verdict,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the King said, for
about the twentieth time that day.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cNo, no!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Queen. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSentence first-verdict afterwards.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cStuff and nonsense!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice loudly. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe idea of having the
sentence first!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHold your tongue!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said the Queen, turning purple.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI won't!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOff with her head!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
moved.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWho cares for you?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by
this time.) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou're nothing but a pack of cards!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWake up, Alice dear!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said her sister; \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWhy, what a long sleep you've
had!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d

\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOh, I've had such a curious dream!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she
had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt _was_ a curious
dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been.


But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all
her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,
and this was her dream:-

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
looking up into hers-she could hear the very tones of her voice, and
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
that _would_ always get into her eyes-and still as she listened, or
seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
strange creatures of her little sister's dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by-the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool-she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution-once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it-once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality-the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds-the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy-and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard-while the
lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
Turtle's heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,
and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,
perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she
would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all
their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer
days.

agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
